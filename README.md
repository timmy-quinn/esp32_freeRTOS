# FreeRTOS Lecture Series

The Digi-Key RTOS lecture series provides a comprehensive introduction to Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS). The lectures are presented by Digi-Key and use FreeRTOS on the ESP32 to illustrate key concepts.

Each lecture concludes with a challenge or problem for viewers to complete. In this repository I've collected my completed problems for each lesson.
